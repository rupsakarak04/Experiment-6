#**EXPERIMENT 6 : Study of conditional statements in Python**

##*AIM*: **To study and implement conditional statements in Python using if, if-else, and if-elif-else to solve different decision-making problems** 

*THEORY*:
Conditional statements in Python are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. They allow a program to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code accordingly.

Python provides the following conditional statements:

1. if Statement
Executes a block of code only if the given condition is true.

2. if-else Statement
Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

3. if-elif-else Statement
Used when multiple conditions need to be checked sequentially.

*ALGORITHM*:

*Program 1: Positive, Negative or zero*
          
      Start
      Input a number
      If number > 0 → Print positive
      Else if number < 0 → Print negative
      Else → Print zero

*Program 2: Even or Odd*

        Start
        Input number
        If number mod 2 equals 0 → Print even
        Else → Print odd

*Program 3: Largest Among Three Numbers*

           Start
           Input three numbers
           Compare numbers using conditional statements
           Print largest number

*Program 4: Grade based on marks*

           Start
           Input marks
           If marks ≥ 90 → Grade A
           Else if marks ≥ 75 → Grade B
           Else if marks ≥ 60 → Grade C
           Else if marks ≥ 40 → Grade D
           Else → Fail
           
*Program 5: Grade using average of threee subjects*

           Start
           Input marks of three subjects
           Calculate average
           Assign grade using conditional statements
           Display grade

*Program 6: Leap Year Check*

            Start
            Input year
            If year divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 OR divisible by 400 → Leap year
            Else → Not leap year

*Program 7: Date Validation and Increment*

            Start
            Input date in dd/mm/yyyy format
            Separate day, month and year
            Check maximum days in month
            Validate date
            Increment date accordingly
            Display next date

  *Program 8: Vowel or Consonant*

            Start
            Input character
            Check if character is present in vowel list
            If yes → Print vowel
            Else → Print consonant

  *Program 9: Salary Calculation*

           Start
           Input basic salary
           Calculate HRA and DA based on salary range
           Calculate gross salary
           Display results  

  *Program 10: Income Tax Calculation*

          Start
          Input annual income
          Apply tax slabs using conditional statements
          Calculate tax
          Display tax amount
  
*CONCLUSION:*

In this experiment, various conditional statements in Python were studied and implemented. The experiment demonstrated how decision-making problems can be solved using if, if-else, and if-elif-else structures. Different real-life applications such as grading systems, leap year verification, salary calculation, and tax computation were successfully implemented. This experiment helped in understanding logical decision-making and improved programming skills in Python.
